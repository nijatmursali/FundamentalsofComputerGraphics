# Foundation of Computer Graphics HOMEWORK 4

## Introduction 

MYOH (1 person, easy), make your own homework:
  1. make small to large environment to show off Yocto/GL that we can use for next year homeworks
  2. these environments should show off the rendering features we demonstrated
  3. we are particularly interested in subdiv examples, displacement maps, etc
  4. the scenes should be compelling and of quality similar to the ones proposed this year
  5. remember to use CC licensed assets only, and include the license for them


## Development 

As mentioned in introduction part, the idea here was to create a scene that had the features that we have mentioned. The following picture shows the model I have created using Blender 2.8 where you can find information from the following [link](https://skfb.ly/6SJpx).
